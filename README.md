# Track: Social Awareness

# Problem Statement:
  People in India are unaware of many government schemes and services that are implemented for 
  their Convenience and Betterment, Even the government sites are not accordingly organized and
  many of them often doesn't work and also the info available related to the schemes and services 
  are scrambled miscellaneously across different platforms which leads to confusion, unawareness, 
  and spreads corruption .
  
# Solution:
  To overcome the above-mentioned problem we have come up with the idea of Project “Varchasva”, 
  a Website. In this Initiative, we are providing a user-friendly and systematic interface where
  the user can access all the information regarding any government schemes and services with access
  to the vast variety of government services at a single platform.
